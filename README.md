DEBUG=taskflow:*
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- Replace `your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_random` with a strong, random string
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use different secrets for development and production

#### 4. Database Setup

**Option A: Docker MongoDB (Recommended for Development)**

**Method 1: Docker Run Command**

```bash
# Pull and run MongoDB in Docker container
docker run -d \
  --name taskflow-mongo \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=taskflow \
  -v taskflow-data:/data/db \
  mongo:latest

# For Windows Command Prompt:
docker run -d --name taskflow-mongo -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=taskflow -v taskflow-data:/data/db mongo:latest

# Check if container is running
docker ps

# View container logs
docker logs taskflow-mongo

# To stop the container
docker stop taskflow-mongo

# To start existing container
docker start taskflow-mongo

# To remove container (careful: this deletes data if no volume used)
docker rm taskflow-mongo

# To remove container and volume
docker rm taskflow-mongo
docker volume rm taskflow-data
```

**Method 2: Docker Compose (Easier Management)**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: taskflow-mongo
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: taskflow
    volumes:
      - taskflow-data:/data/db
    networks:
      - taskflow-network

volumes:
  taskflow-data:

networks:
  taskflow-network:
    driver: bridge
```

```bash
# Start MongoDB with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs mongodb

# Stop MongoDB
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove everything (including data)
docker-compose down -v

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

**Environment Configuration:**

Update your `.env` file with:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/taskflow?authSource=admin
```

**Option B: Local MongoDB Installation**

```bash
# Start MongoDB service (varies by OS)
# Windows: net start mongodb
# macOS: brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
# Linux: sudo systemctl start mongod

# The application will automatically create the database and collections
```

**Option C: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**

1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get your connection string
4. Replace `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file

## 🧠 Smart Assign Logic Explanation

### Problem Statement

Traditional task management relies on manual assignment, which often leads to:

- Uneven workload distribution
- Team members becoming overwhelmed while others are underutilized
- Manual tracking of who has capacity for new work
- Delayed project completion due to bottlenecks

### Solution Architecture

TaskFlow's Smart Assign feature solves this through intelligent automation:

#### 1. **Real-time Workload Analysis**

```
For each team member:
- Count active tasks (Todo + In Progress columns)
- Calculate current workload score
- Rank team members by availability
```

#### 2. **Intelligent Assignment Algorithm**

```
Algorithm Steps:
1. Gather all registered users
2. Filter to active team members
3. Count active tasks per user
4. Identify user with minimum active tasks
5. Assign new task to least busy user
6. Broadcast update to all connected clients
```

#### 3. **Real-World Example**

**Team Setup:**

- Alice: 3 active tasks (2 Todo, 1 In Progress)
- Bob: 1 active task (1 In Progress)
- Charlie: 5 active tasks (4 Todo, 1 In Progress)

**Smart Assign Process:**

1. New task "Fix authentication bug" needs assignment
2. System calculates: Alice=3, Bob=1, Charlie=5
3. Bob has the lowest count (1), so he gets the new task
4. All team members see the assignment instantly
5. Activity log records "Task auto-assigned to Bob"

#### 4. **Benefits**

- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Prevents team member burnout
- **Improved Efficiency**: Tasks go to available team members immediately
- **Transparency**: All assignments are logged and visible
- **Real-time Updates**: No delays in task distribution

## 🛡️ Conflict Resolution System Explanation

### The Challenge

In collaborative environments, conflicts occur when:

- Multiple users edit the same task simultaneously
- Network delays cause updates to arrive out of order
- Users work with outdated information
- Simultaneous changes could overwrite important work

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Version Tracking System**

```javascript
// Each task has a version number
const task = {
  _id: "task123",
  title: "Design homepage",
  status: "todo",
  version: 3, // Increments with each change
  updatedAt: "2025-01-09T10:30:00Z",
};
```

#### 2. **Conflict Detection Process**

```javascript
// When user attempts an update
const updateAttempt = {
  taskId: "task123",
  changes: { status: "in-progress" },
  clientVersion: 3, // Version user currently sees
};

// Server-side validation
if (updateAttempt.clientVersion !== currentTask.version) {
  // Conflict detected!
  return conflictResolution(updateAttempt, currentTask);
}
```

#### 3. **Resolution Workflow**

```
Conflict Detected →
├── Show both versions to user
├── Highlight differences
├── Provide resolution options:
│   ├── Override (use my changes)
│   ├── Merge (combine both changes)
│   └── Refresh (see latest version)
└── Log resolution for audit trail
```

### Real-World Conflict Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Status Change Conflict**

**Setup:**

- Task: "User testing feedback" (Version 2)
- Alice and Bob both viewing the task

**Conflict:**

1. Alice moves task to "In Progress" (Version 3)
2. Bob (still seeing Version 2) moves task to "Done"
3. System detects Bob's version (2) ≠ current version (3)

**Resolution:**

- Bob sees: "Alice recently moved this task to 'In Progress'"
- Bob chooses: Keep Alice's change or override with "Done"
- Decision is logged and broadcast to team

#### **Scenario 2: Content Edit Conflict**

**Setup:**

- Task: "API documentation" (Version 1)
- Sarah and Mike both add notes

**Conflict:**

1. Sarah adds "Include authentication examples" (Version 2)
2. Mike adds "Add rate limiting section" (Version 1 → conflict)

**Resolution:**

- Mike sees both additions
- Options: Merge both notes, keep only his, or refresh
- Combined result: Both requirements included

#### **Scenario 3: Assignment Conflict**

**Setup:**

- Unassigned task: "Database optimization"
- Tom and Lisa both claim it

**Conflict:**

1. Tom assigns to himself (Version 2)
2. Lisa tries to assign to herself (Version 1 → conflict)

**Resolution:**

- Lisa sees Tom already claimed it
- Options: Leave with Tom, reassign to herself, or discuss
- Clear ownership established

### System Benefits

#### **Data Integrity**

- No work is ever lost without user consent
- All changes are tracked and reversible
- Complete audit trail for accountability

#### **User Control**

- Users always see what changed before deciding
- Multiple resolution options available
- Clear information about who made changes

#### **Team Coordination**

- Conflicts become collaboration opportunities
- Transparent decision-making process
- Real-time communication about changes

### Best Practices for Teams

#### **Minimize Conflicts:**

- Refresh your view regularly
- Check activity log before major changes
- Communicate about work in progress
- Make frequent, smaller updates

#### **Handle Conflicts Effectively:**

- Read conflict notifications carefully
- Consider teammate's perspective
- Choose merge when possible
- Communicate with team when uncertain

This robust conflict resolution system ensures TaskFlow remains reliable and trustworthy for mission-critical team collaboration.
